Twenty Seventeen VisOrb
=======================

This is a child theme of the beautiful Twenty Seventeen WordPress
theme, with the one main difference that all pages have the configured
sidebar.

With default Twenty Seventeen, posts get the sidebar, but pages do
not.

To see an example of this child theme in action, go to
http://visible-orbit.org/the-collection/ (this child theme was put
together by cpbotha@vxlabs.com for the Visible Orbit project).

Installation
============

To install this theme, copy the whole twentyseventeen-visorb directory
(the one containing this README) into the wp-content/themes/
sub-directory of your wordpress installation.

Now go to Appearance -> Themes and then you should be able to select
"Twenty Seventeen VisOrb".
